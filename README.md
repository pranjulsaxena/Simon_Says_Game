Simon Says Game
This is a simple Simon Says game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is based on the classic memory game where players must follow a sequence of color-coded buttons. 
The challenge is to remember and repeat the sequence correctly as it gets longer after each level.

How to Play
Start the Game: Press any key to start the game.
Follow the Sequence: The game will display a sequence of colored buttons. The buttons will flash one by one.
Repeat the Sequence: After each flash, click on the buttons in the same order to repeat the sequence.
Game Over: If you click the wrong button or get the sequence wrong, the game will end and show your score (level reached). Press any key to restart the game.

Features
Memory Challenge: The game increases the difficulty by adding more steps to the sequence after each round.
Visual Cues: Buttons flash in different colors, and the user is expected to repeat the same pattern.
Game Over: If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you are shown the level you reached.
Simple Interface: A minimalistic interface with large clickable buttons.
